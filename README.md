GloVe files are too large to upload to GitHub. We used 100-dimensional Twitter vectors for this project. You can find the link to these vectors here: https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/ 

If you cannot unzip the data from the repository directly, feel free to access the data through Kaggle. https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/suchintikasarkar/sentiment-analysis-for-mental-health/data
